        <p>
            If you can access the web, you can participate in the FACT Inspection And Accreditation Workshop! However, to be successful we strongly encourage using
            a PC or Mac with a keyboard, camera, microphone, and strong internet connection.
            <br/>
            In general, here are the specific requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone (although we recommend using a PC or Mac)</li>
                <li>Internet connection (wired is better than wi-fi)</li>
                <li>Modern web browser. The FACT Inspection And Accreditation Workshop will support the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. Internet
                Explorer is not fully supported and you should use a different browser.</li>
                <li><b>Please upgrade to the latest version of your chosen web browser. Although our system supports several versions of Chrome
                and Firefox, we do not support older versions of Edge or Internet Explorer.</b></li>
                <li>If using Microsoft Edge, please make sure you have the latest version. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">You can download it(the latest version of
                Microsoft Edge) here.</a></li>
                <li>Not sure if your browser is up-to-date? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whatismybrowser.com/">Check if it is here</a></li>
                <li>An external or integrated microphone (external is recommended) for meeting sessions. We recommend using a headset with built-in microphone.</li>
                <li>If you plan to participate in the FACT Inspection And Accreditation Workshop from a tablet or smartphone, know that some features will be harder to
                access, although watching sessions will work just fine.</li>
            </ul>

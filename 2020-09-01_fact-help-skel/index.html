        <h2>Best Practices for Meeting Participation (for presenters)</h2>
        <p>To ensure that your participation in the workshop is as successful as possible, we recommend the following best practices:</p>
        <br/>
        <b>Equipment</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>General Requirements</b><br/>
                You will need access to either a PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone. A PC or Mac is recommended. To participate in the meetings, it is recommended that you have an internal or external camera so that you can be seen on video.
            </li>
            <li><b>Microphones</b><br/>
                Clear audio can make a big difference. Laptop/phone audio can work, but audio through an external microphone (connected
                by wire or Bluetooth) can be a huge plus. We recommend:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Headset-H390-Noise-Cancelling/dp/B000UXZQ42/">Logitech USB Headset H390 with Noise Cancelling Mic</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Education-1EDU-AE36WH-ITE-Headphone-Microphone-Single/dp/B00L2JUJ68/">Avid Education 1EDU-AE36WH-ITE Headphone with Boom Microphone, Single Plug, White</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Browser</b><br/>
                The workshop will support the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. IE11 is not fully supported and you
                should use a different browser.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Internet Connection Tips</em><br/>
                    In general, wired connections are better than wireless connections, and wireless connections are better than cellular based connections.</li>
                    <li>While FACT supports tablets and smartphones, we recommend using a PC or Mac as some functions will not work on a tablet or phone.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Your Surroundings</b><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find a quiet area for participation. Avoid areas with loud background noise (traffic, wind, loud vents, or appliances).</li>
                    <li>Be one with the light and find the balance! Try to avoid a dark room. Natural room sunlight is good – just do not stand with the light shining right behind you.</li>
                    <li>Consider the acoustics of the room. A small room with dead acoustics will not flatter a voice.</li>
                    <li>Position yourself relatively close to the camera</li>
                    <li>Frame the camera so that your eyes are in the top third of the frame.</li>
                    <li>Use a plain, uncluttered background.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare for the Unexpected</b><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is technology, some things *may* go wrong.</li>
                    <li>Have a back-up plan for if someone gets sick, if someone’s internet connection drops, if a laptop crashes, if someone’s audio goes haywire. Can someone quickly take over the presentation?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

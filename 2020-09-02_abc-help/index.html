        <h2>LOGGING IN TO ABC</h2>
        <p>
            Since you are accessing these FAQ’s from within the ABC virtual meeting, we assume you were able to
            log in successfully.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Can someone else log in for me?</b><br/>
                No, your login information is specific to you and should be kept private. For security purposes,
                you can only be logged in from one location at a time.</li>
                <li><b>What equipment and technical specifications are needed to access ABC and participate in
                the private meetings?</b><br/>
                If you can access the web, you can participate! However, to be successful we strongly encourage using a PC or Mac with a
                keyboard, camera, microphone, and strong internet connection.<br/>
                <br/>
                In general, here are the specific requirements:
                <ul>
                    <li>PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone (PC or Mac is highly recommended)</li>
                    <li>Internet connection (wired is better than wi-fi)</li>
                    <li>Modern web browser. ABC thrives in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Edge. IE11 is not fully supported and you
                    should use a different browser.</li>
                    <li><b>Please upgrade to the latest version of your chosen web browser. Although our system supports several versions of Chrome
                    and Firefox, we do not support older versions of Edge or Internet Explorer.</b></li>
                    <li><b>If using Microsoft Edge, please make sure you have the latest version. You can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?form=MY01BL&OCID=MY01BL" target="_blank">download it here.</a></b></li>
                    <li>If you plan to participate from a tablet or smartphone, there are certain features that will not be enabled for you,
                    including screen sharing and chat in the private meetings.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Can I access the platform before the event begins to confirm my equipment will work?</b><br/>
                    Yes, attendees will be given access to the virtual event platform beginning September 2nd. Additionally, on September
                    2nd and 10th, a test version of the private meetings will be available from 10:00am – 4:00pm Eastern Time. Visit the “MY
                    SCHEDULE” tab to access the meeting on your schedule. In the test meeting, you can test your camera and microphone and
                    explore the features and controls of the private meeting rooms.<br/>
                    <br />
                    <b>Please note: </b>the Test Meeting room is open to ALL attendees during this time. It is <u>not</u> a private room.
                </li>
                <li><b>How do I sign up for notifications?</b><br/>
                You can sign up for notifications by clicking on the “bell” icon on the bottom left hand corner of the
                screen. Notifications can be sent to desktop browsers or mobile devices.</li>

            <li><b>Can we continue the meeting past the scheduled stop time?</b><br>

        <h2>BEST PRACTICES FOR MEETING PARTICIPATION</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure that your participation in ABC is as successful as possible, we recommend the following best practices:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Equipment</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>General requirements
                        <ul><li>You will need access to either a PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone. A PC or Mac is recommended. To participate in the
                        meetings, it is recommended that you have an internal or external camera so that you can be seen on video.</li></ul></li>
                        
                        <li>Microphones<br/>
                        Clear audio can make a big difference. Laptop/phone audio can work, but audio through an external microphone (connected
                        by wire or Bluetooth) can be a huge plus. We recommend: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Logitech USB Headset H390 with Noise Cancelling Mic</li>
                                <li>Avid Education 1EDU-AE36WH-ITE Headphone with Boom Microphone, Single Plug, White</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Browser
                            <ul><li>ABC will support the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. IE11 is not fully supported and you should
                            use a different browser.</li></ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>Internet Connection Tips
                            <ul><li> general, wired connections are better than wireless connections, and wireless connections are better than cellular
                            based connections.</li></ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>While ABC supports tablets and smartphones, we recommend using a PC or Mac as some functions will not work on a tablet
                        or phone.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Your Surroundings</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find a quiet area for participation. Avoid areas with loud background noise (traffic, wind, loud vents, or appliances).</li>
                        <li>Be one with the light and find the balance! Try to avoid a dark room. Natural room sunlight is good – just do not stand</li>
                        <li>with the light shining right behind you.</li>
                        <li>Consider the acoustics of the room. A small room with dead acoustics will not flatter a voice.</li>
                        <li>Position yourself relatively close to the camera</li>
                        <li>Frame the camera so that your eyes are in the top third of the frame.</li>
                        <li>Use a plain, uncluttered background.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Screen Sharing</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use two monitors: one for the video chat; one for the presentation</li>
                        <li>If sharing full-screen in Powerpoint, you sometimes have to share out a separate window or you’ll see the Presenter’s view</li>
                        <li>Or have another team member run the presentation</li>
                        <li>Practice ahead of your presentation</li>

                    <b>Meeting Participation</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We encourage participants to turn on their camera in the private meeting rooms so that other participants can see who is talking. But please note that only 16 people can be on video at once in the private meeting rooms.</li>
                        <li>Please mute yourself when not talking to avoid background interruptions (barking dogs, phones ringing, family members talking etc.)</li>
                        <li style="color: red">Please review the Code of Conduct for online meetings – LINK up to the PDF provided - ML</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Have a Meeting Plan</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since only 12 people at a time can be on video, make a plan with your team to decide who will be on video, who will speak when, who will share the presentation, etc.</li>
                        <li>Consider coordinating your meeting agenda with your trading partner. You can contact them ahead of time via email or phone (if you have their contact information) or you can use the messaging feature in ABC site.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Prepare for the Unexpected</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is technology, some things *may* go wrong.</li>
                        <li>Have a back-up plan for if someone gets sick, if someone’s internet connection drops, if a laptop crashes, if someone’s audio goes haywire. Can someone quickly take over the presentation?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

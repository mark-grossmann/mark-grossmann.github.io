          <h3 style="text-align: center;">I am an artist, programmer, composer, and educator.</h3>
            <br/><p>
            <p>As a student at New York University studying Music composition, I started with a focus on writing electronic music and became increasingly
            interested in writing and coding “computer music” in the dataflow programming language Max/Msp.<br/>
            <br/>
            I furthered these skills in an intensive course at IRCAM in Paris and while working at Harvestworks Media Arts Center where
            I coded for, built, and maintained a space for multi-speaker compositions to be experienced.<br/>
            <br/>
            I continued taking courses within the Music Technology program as well as courses in the Computer Science department at NYU, where I
            received a minor in Web Programming and Applications. During my senior year, I worked as a Programming Tutor for the Music Technology
            department, as well as a Studio Technician.<br/>
            <br/>
            As a composer and performer, audience interaction and experience are everything to me. As a Web Programmer, I still hold that concept at
            the core of my work. I strive to craft both web projects and compositions that get people engaged and leave a lasting impression.<br/>
            <br/></p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">I’m currently looking for positions in Digital Marketing and front-end development.<br/></p>
